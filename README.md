# Introduction
Here are the works of Lizk and WangDiYi in CASIA.
# Including
1. Codes for embedding&RNN are in the folder "RNN_lizk".Dealing with the One-basket problem, we put the embedding method into the recurrent nerual network. Until now, these part of works are not being well. If you have any idea or questions, pls contact us.
2. Codes for the libsvm: (in the script "testing.py"and "10_19_1.py")
